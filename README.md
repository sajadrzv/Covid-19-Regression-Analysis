# Covid-19 Cases Regression-Analysis
We want to check the significant factors influencing the Covid-19 cases in different states of U.S.A
In this Project , I am going to create a regression model to analyze number of Covid-19 cases with Socio-economic and 
demographic variables to determine which variables are significantly associated with the increase in number of Covid-19 cases 
within the various states of United States.It is worth mentioning that data was extracted from various sources and reports, 
most of which were website sources data.
